Write a code that initializes three variables, a, b and c with the values 9, 2, and 11 (respectively).

After that, initialize the following variables:

d that will hold the result of a modulo 2 
e that will hold the result of a modulo 3
f that will hold the result of c modulo 10
Check out the result and see how different dividends and divisors affect the result.
